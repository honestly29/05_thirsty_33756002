# The Thirsty Student – Web App

A simple Node.js and Express web application built in the Dynamic Web Applications lab to demonstrate dynamic routing, EJS templating, and basic form handling.

---

## Overview

**The Thirsty Student** is a fictional drinks shop website that:

- Displays shop information and locations.
- Lists product categories.
- Includes a customer **survey page** that collects user input (first name, surname, email, age, favourite drink category, and whether they are a student).
- Displays the survey results on a new page after submission.

No registration or database storage is required — survey results are only shown temporarily on screen.

The application is deployed and running online on a virtual server.
It is hosted permanently using the forever process manager, which keeps the Node.js app active even after the terminal session is closed.
